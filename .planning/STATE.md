# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-11-09)

**Core value:** A fresh Gamebloke instance, given a named GBA profile, content, and timed logical input, produces deterministic, observable, evidence-backed machine behavior, and every result says exactly what it proves and what it does not.
**Current milestone:** v1.0 Evidence Spine (a GSD milestone label, not a software version)
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — CI and Verification Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (CI and Verification Foundation) — EXECUTING
Plan: 1 of 11
Status: Executing Phase 01
Last activity: 2026-11-09 — Phase 01 execution started

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Milestone v1.0 is spine first (G10 default). SUMMARY phases 1-3 are split into six phases. CI lands first; diagnostics come before determinism gates.
- [Roadmap]: Fixture policy runs on reversible defaults: pinned SHA-256 fetch, no third-party binaries in tree, no logo bytes in owned fixtures (G2, G3).
- [Roadmap]: The VERIF-06 sanitizer lanes land in Phase 1, so the CPU work (CPU-05) is UBSan-gated from its first commit.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- G1 (license) is open. The public repo has no LICENSE, so default copyright applies. This does not block v1.0. Do not add a LICENSE without the owner.
- Phase 5: the xPack toolchain identity (ARMv4T, identical bytes on macOS and Linux) is [UNK]. The spike gates any committed ROM digest; the fallback is Linux digest ownership.
- Phase 1: the GitHub runner image names in the research are unverified [UNK].
- Next milestone (v2.0) needs G4 (stub authoring) approval before stub work begins.
